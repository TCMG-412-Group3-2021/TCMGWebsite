        <img src="brendan.jpeg" alt="Pic of Brendan" width="400" height="250">
        <p>Howdy! My name is Brendan Ramirez. I am a senior Technology Management major with a minor in Business. I am seeking to go straight into graduate school upon graduation. My favorite part about being a 
          student at Texas A&M has been being able to network with people from different backgrounds. I am involved in multiple organizations here on campus and each of them play a huge role in shaping my network. Outside of school, 
          my interests include attending music festivals, sporting events, and making music. I am looking very forward to the rest of what this semester has in store!</p>
        <h2>Mark Trevino '22</h2>

        <p>
          My name is Mark Trevino and I am a senior Computer Science major. After graduation, I want 
          to become a Software Developer to write code that will be impactful in people's lives.
          Outside of school, I enjoy playing games, reading, and watching movies. One day, I hope to
          become a director. I look forward to learning more DevOps in this course throughout the semester!
        </p>

        <p>
          Howdy! My name is Jeremiah John and I am a senior Technology Management major with a minor in Business.
          After college, I plan to either begin work or pursue a masters degree. Throughout my years at Texas A&M,
          I have met many great individuals through the classes that I have taken and the organizations that I have
          been apart of. These reasons are why I believe this school has much to offer and I have enjoyed my time here.
          In my free time, my interest include working out, playing basketball, playing videogames, cooking, and watching
          sports. I can't wait to see what I learn in TCMG 412 and I look forward to finding out!
