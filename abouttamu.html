        <h1>About Our School</h1>
        <p>Texas A&M is a public land grant reasearch university that was founded in 1876. At its inception, it was an all male
          military institute that produced many military officers. Texas A&M is a land, sea, and space grant instituition and 
          was one of the first to hold all three of these designations. They are also one of the few colleges to have branch 
          campuses all over the world such as the one in Doha, Qatar. Today Texas A&M has over 70,000 enrolled students and
          well over half a million former students. Needless to say, Texas A&M is a premier college not only in the state of 
          Texas, but in the world.
          
          Texas A&M University is dedicated to the discovery, development, communication, and application of knowledge 
          in a wide range of academic and professional fields. Its mission of providing the highest quality undergraduate 
          and graduate programs is inseparable from its mission of developing new understandings through research and 
          creativity. It prepares students to assume roles in leadership, responsibility and service to society. Texas 
          A&M assumes as its historic trust the maintenance of freedom of inquiry and an intellectual environment nurturing 
          the human mind and spirit. It welcomes and seeks to serve persons of all racial, ethnic and geographic groups as 
          it addresses the needs of an increasingly diverse population and a global economy. In the 21st century, Texas A&M 
          University seeks to assume a place of preeminence among public universities while respecting its history and traditions.
